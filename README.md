# Crypter

Welcome to Crypter! a ransomware and builder package written entirely in Python and compiled to a Windows executable using [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/). This README will provide you with all of the information necessary to understand, build and use this software.

**Please note that by making use of this repository you accept and agree with the disclaimer section of this README.**

Click [here](https://youtu.be/r3jaNHmkkXE) for a video demonstration of Crypter and [here](../../releases) to download the Crypter distributable release, which contains the Crypter repository and all of the required dependencies in a single, convenient package.

 ## Disclaimer - IMPORTANT
Crypter is intended for educational and research purposes only. This software should not be used within any system or network for which you do not have permission, nor should it be used for any illegal or illicit purposes. The author takes no responsibility for any damages that may be caused by the software in this repository. 

Once compiled, Crypter WILL encrypt the files on the computer on which it is executed. Whilst Crypter provides you with access to the decryption key (enabling you to decrypt any encrypted files), bugs and other issues could, in theory, interrupt or prevent a successful decryption. 

Consequently, a permanent and irreversible loss of data could occur. To avoid any potential damage, you should only run Crypter on a test machine created for this purpose.

Once again, **the author accepts no responsibility for any damages that may occur, and by downloading this software you accept and agree to this disclaimer.**

## Roadmap
Future updates, subprojects and areas of focus, in order of priority:
 - Improvements to packaging, documentation and general ease-of-use
 - Additional customisation options for the ransomware
 - Creation of a CnC component
 
Recently completed updates/subprojects include:
 - Creation of a builder GUI application for customising and building Crypter

## Repository Structure
If you're unsure of the components that make up this repository, the following explanation should give you some insight:
```
Crypter
| -- Crypter\ (The actual ransomware code)
| -- build\ (The builder application, configuration and resources used to produce the PyInstaller binary)
  | -- ExeBuilder\ (The Crypter builder package and application)
  | -- Resources\ (Holds resources that are bundled with, and used to build, the Crypter executable)
  | -- builder_gui\ (Contains the wxFormBuilder GUI project, including prototypes, for the Builder)
  | -- Builder.pyw (Launches the builder. Run this script to open the builder application)
  | -- config_example.cfg (An example configuration file that can be loaded into the Builder)
| -- gui\ (The Crypter GUI project files. These can be viewed and edited using wxFormBuilder
| -- sample_images\ (Simply contains sample images used in this README)
```

## Prerequisites
Before cloning the repository and attempting to build Crypter, you must first meet the following prerequisites. You'll then have all the tools required to launch the builder and create the executable.

**Due to the confusion and room-for-error surrounding these dependencies, this repository has been packaged with the additional required software shown in the table below, and can be downloaded as a .zip from the [Releases](../../releases) page**(Coming soon upon version 2.0 release)

**Note:** You should install the software in the exact order shown in the table below, from top to bottom. Without these you wont be able to launch the builder. Errors or issues you may encounter will most likely stem from missing or invalid dependencies.

| Requirement | Supported Versions | Recommended Version |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Microsoft Windows | 7, 8, 10, Server 2K8 and above | 10 |
| Python | 2.7.13 (x86) | [2.7.13 (x86)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) |
| Pyinstaller | 3.1.1, 3.2.1 | [3.1.1](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/releases/tag/v3.1.1) |
| Microsoft VC++ for Python | 9.0 | [9.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=44266) |
| pypiwin32 | 219 | [219](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/) |
| PyCrypto | 2.6.1 | [2.6.1](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto) |
| Ordered Dict | 1.1 | [1.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ordereddict) |
| WxPython | 3.0 | [3.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.0.0/) |
| \*UPX | 3.94w | [3.94w](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/tag/v3.94) |

\*The [UPX Packer](https://upx.github.io/) is an optional, but highly recommended tool that the builder can use to pack the ransomware executable. UPX will allow you to reduce the size of the binary that PyInstaller produces by several Megabytes.

Once the above software is installed you will be able to launch the builder.

## How can I build Crypter?
Providing you've met the above prerequisites, building Crypter is now easy thanks to the newly added builder application.

- Run the *Builder.pyw* script in the *build* directory of this repository to launch the builder.
- Change any desired options, or leave the fields as they are to build Crypter with the default configuration.
- Click the BUILD button at the bottom of the app to start the build.
- Check the *bin* directory (created during the build) in the root of the repository for the produced binary.

A more detailed guide on building and using the Crypter package will be added to the repository's Wiki in the future.

## How does Crypter work?
Crypter's approach is fairly conventional, but the lack of a CnC component does result in different behaviour (see the [Crypter video demonstration](https://youtu.be/r3jaNHmkkXE)). Rather than sending the key to a remote server, Crypter instead writes it to a local file so that the files can be easily decrypted. Once executed, the following steps are taken:

1. Generates an AES-256 bit key and writes it to key.txt in the current directory
    - You can use this key in the Crypter GUI to decrypt your files
2. Searches the following directories for files to encrypt:
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Desktop
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Documents
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Downloads
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Music
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Pictures
    - [USER_HOME_DIR]\Videos    
3. Encrypts all matching files
4. Displays the Crypter GUI to the victim

A more in-depth breakdown of these activities will be added to the repository's Wiki in the future.

## Why was Crypter created?
Given Crypter's malicious capabilities, as well as the disclaimer in this README, you may be wondering why Crypter was created. The primary goal of this project was to provide a proof-of-concept which demonstrated Python's capabilities as a language for real-world malware development. Traditionally, compiled languages like C and C++ have been the chosen platforms of malware authors. Today however, a general advancement of platforms and tools has introduced attractive alternatives which extend these opportunities to other languages. 

As an incredibly popular, beginner-friendly language with an immense wealth of third party support, Python allows developers to quickly create powerful tools without the overhead of a lower-level language. These characteristics are likely responsible for the increase in Python-based malware pieces observed in recent years, and will also likely influence and impact future trends in the area. Examples of such pieces include:

+ [PWOBot](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-python-based-pwobot-targets-european-organizations/)
+ [PyCL](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pycl-ransomware-delivered-via-rig-ek-in-distribution-test/)
+ [CryPy](http://www.zdnet.com/article/python-ransomware-encrypts-files-with-unique-keys-one-at-a-time/)
+ [HolyCrypt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-python-ransomware-called-holycrypt-discovered/)

Whilst similar projects do exist on GitHub, few are structured in the same way. Crypter aims to expand upon these by providing a *cryptolocker* style Python-based ransomware piece, which can be easily customised and built.
